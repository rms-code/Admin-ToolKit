## Admin-ToolKit
Admin Toolkit for adding users with mailbox/lync, mail management for spam removal.

This is just a quick dirty Admin tool for our secure admin stations, instead of having to goto different servers/management consoles, combines adding a user, which OU/Groups, mailbox/lync enabled, also has mail removal from all mailboxs or OU/user (incase spam gets through and you want to rip it out), and some computer moving options.

### Make sure you update all commented area's to search your environment (searchbase's and targetpaths)

#### Powershell studio is used to compile this.
